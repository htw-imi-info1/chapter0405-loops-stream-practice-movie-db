Example Project Simplified from the Movie1 we did in class

Examples given:
1) Find all movies that you watched released in 2016
2) Delete all movies released in a given year

Exercises:

Ex 1) print out all the numbers:
Given an array of numbers, print out all the 
numbers in the array, using a for loop. 
int[] numbers = { 4, 1, 22, 9, 14, 3, 9}; 
for ...

Ex 2) add title field to movie
Ex 3) print all movies with titles containing a searchString
Ex 4) delete all movies with an exact given title

-- the same with director

Ex 5) add a director field to movie
Ex 6) print all movies directed by a certain director
Ex 7) delete all movies from a certain director

-- and to practice reduce:
Ex 14) add a duration field to movie
Ex 15) how long would it take to watch all movies
        - in a given year
        - from a certain director

-- more plain for loop
Ex 8) in ArrayAndForLoop, add a method int min(int[] a) that returns the index of the smallest element.
Ex 9) in ArrayAndForLoop, add a method int sum(int[] a) that returns the sum of all elements in the array.
Ex 13) Print all Movies with a number using a for loop.


Ex 13) Print all Movies with a number using a for loop.
